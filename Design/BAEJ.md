# BAEJ

BAEJ is a Reduced Instruction Set Computer Architecture which implements a load store architecture

## Registers

|Registers | Address | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
|.f0 - .f15|0-15|General purpose 'function registers' where data is not lost after a function call|
|.t0 - .t28|16-44|General purpose 'temporary registers' where data may be overridden during a function call|
|.a0 - .a5 |45-50|Argument registers for function calls|
|.m0 - .m5 |51-56|Accumulator register on which default mathematical operations are committed|
|.cr       |57|Compiler register|
|.pc       |58|Program counter register|
|.v0 - .v1 |59-60|Return value register from a function call|
|.ra       |61|Return address register|
|.sp       |62|Stack pointer register|
|.z0       |63|Register always holding the value 0|

### Function Registers
Function registers are magic! You are able to use them (.f0 - .f15) without worry of loosing the data after a function call. The best part? You don't even need to back them up to a stack... or anywhere! Thanks to some nifty magic.
**How does the magic work?** The 16 function registers available to you anywhere are actually part of a larger register file consisting of 128 registers. To address all 128 of these registers we have designed a 3 bit register that is called the function call counter (FCC). The FCC stores the count of how many function calls have been made without returning. By using the following formula we can get the next 16 registers in the larger file.

``` target = (FCC * 16) + register ```

For example, if we have made only one function call, FCC would be 1. If we wanted to address our third function register (.f2) we would take  ``` 1 * 16 + 2 ``` to get 18. This means we would be addressing the 18th register in the larger file by using .f2 in our function. This makes sense because registers 0 - 15 would be owned by the place from where our function would be called, thus the 18th register is the third one available to us. If more than 7 function calls are made (the largest value the FCC can hold) then what?

>**Options**
>* Use special memory unit for both memory and backing up registers (Hard but extra credit)
>* Increase FCC to 12 bits and limit to 4096 function calls (easy)
>* Use a dedicated memory unit to backup entire register file (medium possibly extra credit) 128 bit words

#### Contingency

If we continue to run into issues with the proposed plan for f registers as described above, or hit an impassable roadblock, our contingency plan is to only use 15 registers addressed normally which will be required by functions to be backed up on the stack in memory.

## Machine Code Formats

**I**	|<sup>15</sup> OPCODE <sup>12</sup>|<sup>11</sup>    RS    <sup>6</sup>|<sup>5</sup>    RD    <sup>0</sup>|	(1<sup>st</sup> word)


â€‹	|<sup>15</sup>                  IMMEDIATE                   <sup>0</sup>|	(2<sup>nd</sup> word)

>I type instructions use the format above. They are multi-word instructions with the first word consisting of a 4 bit op code followed by two 6 bit register addresses. The second word will be the 16 bit immediate value used in the instruction.

**G**	|<sup>15</sup> OPCODE <sup>12</sup>|<sup>11</sup>    RS    <sup>6</sup>|<sup>5</sup>    RD    <sup>0</sup>|	(1<sup>st</sup> word)

> G type instructions use the same format as I type as described above. They do not, however, have an immediate and only have one word in their machine code format.

## Instructions

|Instruction|Type|OP|Usage|Description|Rtl|
|-----------|----|--|-----|-----------|---|
|```lda```|I Type|0000|```lda .rs[index] .rd```|Loads a value from memory to rd|```rd=Mem[rs+index]```|
|```ldi```|I Type|0001|```ldi .rd immediate```|Loads an immediate to rd|```rd=immediate```|
|```str```|I Type|0010|```str .rs[index] .rd```|Stores value in rd to memory|```Mem[rs+index]=rd```|
|```bop```|I Type|0011|```bop immediate```|Changes pc to immediate|```pc=immediate```|
|```cal```|I Type|0100|```cal immediate```|Changes pc to immediate and sets a return address|```ra=pc+4```<br>```pc=immediate```|
|```beq```|I Type|0101|```beq .rs .rd immediate```|Changes pc to immediate if rs and rd are equal|```if rs==rd```<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```pc=immediate;```|
|```bne```|I Type|0110|```bne .rs .rd immediate```|Changes pc to immediate if rs and rd aren't equal|```if rs!=rd```<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```pc=immediate;```|
|```sft```|I Type|0111|```sft .rs .rd immediate```|Shifts value in rs to rd by immediate. Positive shifts left, negative shifts right|```rd=rs<<immediate```|
|```cop```|G Type|1000|```cop .rs .rd```|Copies the value of rs to rd while retaining the original value of rs|```rd=rs```|
|```slt```|G Type|1010|```slt .rs .rd```|Sets cr to a value other than 0 if rs is less than rd|```t0=rs<rd?1:0```|
|```ret```|G Type|1011|```ret```|Sets pc to the value in ra|```pc=ra```|
|```add```|G Type|1100|```add .rs [.rm]```|Adds rs into the accumulator*|``` [rm]+=rs```|
|```sub```|G Type|1101|```sub .rs [.rm]```|Subtracts rs from the accumulator*|```[rm]-=rs```|
|```and```|G Type|1110|```and .rs [.rm]```|Ands rs with the accumulator*|```[rm]^=rs```|
|```orr```|G Type|1111|```orr .rs [.rm]```|Ors rs with the accumulator*|```[rm]|=rs```|
***optional argument of .rm specifies an accumulator register to operate on (defaults to .m0)**

## Function Calls

Function calls are made easy with BAEJ. When calling a function the programmer simply places the arguments in registers a0 - a5 and uses the command ```cal <FUNCTION>```. The instruction will jump the program counter to the address of the function while also putting the previous value of the program counter plus 2 into the return address register. The function will then return with ```ret``` which returns to the address in the ra register. The programmer can expect their data in f registers to be retained while they should not expect data in any other register to be retained. After a function returns, returned values will be in the v registers.

### Hardware

- PC Adder

  > This component is a combinational logic component which takes two inputs, one 16 bit input, and one 1 bit input (the first wire from the op code). With the single bit input low, the adder will add 2 to the 16 bit input. With the single bit input high, the adder will add nothing to the 16 bit input. This is the component that will be used to increment the adder.

- Address Adder

  > This component is a standard adder which will be used to add the A and ImR registers when addressing memory for load and store instructions. It will have the two 16 bit inputs and one 16 bit output and no control signals

- Registers

  > A general register component takes in one 16 bit input for writing a value into the register, and has one 16 bit output signal for reading the value out of the register. Registers do not have any control signals.  A general register component implements the following RTL symbols:

  - A & B

    > These registers are used for holding data values retrieved out of the register file for use as inputs in the ALU.

  - ALUout

    > This register is used for holding the output of the ALU (for lda and ldi).

  - FCC

    > The FCC (function call counter) register is used to hold the current count of function calls for use in addressing f-register backups to the f-register cache.

  - PC

    > The PC (program counter) register is used to track the current address in memory of a program.

  - ra

    > The ra (return address) register gets the address of PC+2 when a function call is made.

  - cr

    > The cr (compiler register) is for temporary use by the assembler in functions such as slt.

  - IR

    > The IR (instruction register) holds the 16 bits of instruction pulled from instruction memory at the address value stored in PC.

  - ImR

    > The ImR (immediate register) holds the 16 bits of data pulled from instruction memory at PC+2. For I-type instructions, these 16 bits are the immediate value associated with the instruction.

- ALU 

  > The ALU will have two 16 bit input signals and one 3 bit control input signal. The output of the ALU is the result of the specified operation on the two 16 bit input signals. The list of operations that the ALU can perform are ```add``` , ```sub```, ```and```, ```or```, and ```slt``` (this list is tentative). In the RTL, the ALU writes to ALUOut (for memory reference), Register File (for storing the result), and FCC (to increment and decrement the cache pointer for calls) .

- Comparator

  > The comparator will be used in order to determine if two inputs are equal. It does this much quicker than the ALU would as it utilizes a series of 16 xor gates to try and 0 out a number and or's it with 0 at the end after all of the xors and inverts the result, yielding an isEqual result. 

- F Register Cache

  > The F Register Cache is composed of the 128 "f" registers that are on reserve depending on your FCC. In order to keep all "f" registers backed up so the user doesn't have to, when another function is called, depending on FCC, all "f" registers are immediately stored in a cache that has 256 bit words. Two control signals, a Fread and a Fwrite, are necessary. When Fread is high, then we will be taking in a 256 bit bus of the "f" registers and storing them in the cache. When Fwrite is high, we are writing all of the "f" registers from the cache into the 256 bit bus. These words will hold the 16 16-bit "f" registers specific to each allocated slot determined by the FCC.
- Dual-port Register File

  > This component will be a file of 64 16 bit registers. It will take four inputs, two address inputs, and two data inputs. It will have two data outputs. The control signals will be RegReadA, RegReadB, RegWriteA, and RegWriteB. With a RegRead control signal high, the data at it's respective address input will be put on on it's respective output bus, and with the signal low, nothing happens. With a RegWrite control signal high, the data on it's respective input bus will be written to the address on it's respective address input.

- Dual-port Memory

  > This component will be a memory unit with the ability to read and write two items at once. It will have four inputs, two address inputs, and two data inputs. It will have two data outputs. The control signals will be MemReadA, MemReadB, MemWriteA, and MemWriteB. With a MemRead control signal high, the data at it's respective address input will be put on on it's respective output bus, and with the signal low, nothing happens. With a MemWrite control signal high, the data on it's respective input bus will be written to the address on it's respective address input.
