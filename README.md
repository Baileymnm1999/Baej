# What is this?
Baej was a RISC Architecture designed and implemented during my sophmore year of college with 3 other students. I was very passionate about this project at the time and put lots of time and care into the design and implementation. Much of Baej is my sophmore year brainchild. Our architectures were ultimately graded against a number of factors, one of which being a recursive algorithm. In the home stretch of this project I ended up implementing a very specific optimization targeting recursive algorithms allowing up to 16 register values to be cached in memory close to the cpu during a procedure call removing the need for usage of a stack in recursive methods. This optimization resulted with us having the fastest execution time with this algoritm in our section.
