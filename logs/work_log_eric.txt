Discussed implementation strategy for the BAEJ Assembly Language.

Tuesday, January 8, 2019 [50 min (1), 200 min (2)]: 
Implementing modulus using BAEJ and helped with the summation function. 
When challenges arose, I discussed certain implementations that were needed to satisfy
the requirements for the functions.
Began work on implementing Euclid's algorithm in our language.
