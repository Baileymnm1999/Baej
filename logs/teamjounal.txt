Milestone 1

MEETING 1.0 - 01/07/2019 - 12:40 pm
Members Present: Alex, Josh, Bailey
	(Eric not present due to miscommunication on members present's parts)

We decided to use a load/store architecture to build our processor. Part of the reason was it would be the easiest architecture to use in order to have 16-bit immediates. We could also use an accumulator style for math instructions using a dedicated register. 

MEETING 1.1 - 01/08/2019 - 2:30 pm
All members present & on time

Discussed how to construct instructions (ie how to divide bits to opcodes, regs, etc), registers. Decided that we would use more registers in favor of speed as opposed to using the stack. To account for this, we would have 128 function registers that would be represented by the first 16 "f" regs that could be all accessed by using (FCC * 16) + regs. 


MEETING 1.2 - 01/08/2019 - 8:30 pm 
All members present

Began working on translating Euclid's Algorithm, relPrime, and other small algorithms to demonstrate operations. Also translated our instructions to machine code. 

MEETING 1.3 - 01/09/2019 - 1:30 pm 
All members present

Finished Euclid's algorithm and relPrime. Translated the assembly language snippets to machine code. Polished the document. Completed Milestone 1. Pushed everything to git log in Design branch.

Milestone 2 

MEETING 2.0 - 01/14/2019 - 5:10 pm 
Members Present: Josh, Bailey, Eric 
Put the skeleton of the RTL in the table and mapped out what kind of registers we need for our RTL and what they do 

MEETING 2.1 - 01/15/2019 - 5:30 pm
All members present 
Finished the RTL write-up for all instructions. Polished them. 
NOTE: REMEMBER TO REMOVE THE "MOV" INSTR!!!
