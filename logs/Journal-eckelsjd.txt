Monday, January 7, 2019 [50 min]: Decisions on architecture type. Load-store with accumulators considered.
			Listing necessary functions to implement.

Tuesday, January 8, 2019 [50 min (1), 90 min (2)]: Assigning registers (Function regs, args, etc.). 2 instruction types (G and I).
			Began work on implementing Euclid's algorithm in our language. Worked on desgin document.

Wednesday, January 9, 2019 [120 min]: Finishing translation of relPrime into BAEJ and machine language. Reformatting document.

Monday, January 14, 2019 [60 min]: Working on RTL for milestone 2. Dividing up instructions into multiple cycles. Excel document made for RTL.

Tuesday, January 15, 2019 [90 min]: Finished RTL table, discussed shopping list and control signals

Wednesday, January 16, 2019 [120 min]: Finished M2, discussion of each item in shopping list, method for verifying our RTL.
					Wrote up description for all of the registers we used in our RTL.

Sunday, January 20, 2019 [150 min]: Working on M3. Walked through RTL and drew datapath on whiteboard appropriately. Just a rough draft.
                                    Needs a lot of work tomorrow. Still need to document all of our changes and new updates.

Monday, January 21, 2019 [150 min]: Working on control signals, bit sizes, purposes, and functionality in our datapath. Writing this up
                                    in the Design document as a table with complete list and description of all control signals.

Tuesday, January 22, 2019 [250 min]: Fixing formatting of hardware components in design document. Learning verilog. Created verilog modules for
                                     16-bit adder, 1-bit mux, and comparator (including test benches for each).

Monday, January 28, 2019 [330 min]: Finished implementations and extensive test benches on 1-bit mux, 2-bit mux, adder, and ALU.
				    ALU still has some bugs in it. Need to do regs as well.

Sunday, February 3, 2019 [60 min]: Discussed rest of project. Divided up work. Began on control unit. Will begin working on ALU sub-system for integration plan.

Monday, February 4, 2019 [90 min]: Worked with Alex. Finished control unit and test bench. Noticed a lot of inconsistencies in naming conventions.

Wednesday, January 30, 2019 [60 min]: ALU bugs fixed. Decided we don't need actual reg hardware; they can just be instantiated whenever we need them.

Sunday, February 3, 2019 [90 min]: Worked on control unit. Planned out the rest of our design; split up who will be working on which integration system.
				   Realized issue with backing up Ra.
